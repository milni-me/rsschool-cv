*I can no longer resist this and it's time to admit that the present (and I hope the future to) is for IT))) And I hope that this time I will get great pleasure from learning a new programming language for me and it will become my favorite and main activity.
My first attempts to come to IT were in 2005 (the last century, yes)) and I even received a diploma as a web designer and programmer (html php), but I didnâ€™t work with this  - my preferences were given to another field of activity. However, understanding the basics of programming helped me often in running websites and in the digital marketing.*
