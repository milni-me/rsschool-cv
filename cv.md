*I can no longer resist this and it's time to admit that the present (and I hope the future to) is for IT))) And I hope that this time I will get great pleasure from learning a new programming language for me and it will become my favorite and main activity.
My first attempts to come to IT were in 2005 (the last century, yes)) and I even received a diploma as a web designer and programmer (html php), but I didn’t work with this  - my preferences were given to another field of activity. However, understanding the basics of programming helped me often in running websites and in the digital marketing.*

*I really like to understand "how does it work?" (for any sphere of reality). Therefore, as there is more information to study as better. I work well in a team, but also calmly take responsibility personally. 16 years of experience in marketing and organizing events taught me to be stress-resistant, quickly respond to problems, find and make urgent decisions, manage a team and take responsibility.
I finished studying programming languages ​​in 2006 and never returned to it. I mainly upgraded my skills in graphic design and related fields (advertising and event-marketin).
I studied English at the university. The language was in passive for a long time , but now it is in the active process of restoring to its previous level (now between B1 and B2).
Native language is Russian (and also Belarusian).*
